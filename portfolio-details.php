          <h1>Math for Fun</h1>
          <p>
            <h2>1.Fun Brain</h2> 
              Find math games by topic or by grade at FunBrain. On this math site for kids, students can enjoy playing a variety of games that reinforce key mathematical concepts and engage young learners. Many of these games focus on a fun theme, like sports, animals or unique landscapes. Educational videos are also included, and there’s a special “Playground” with games suited to pre-K and kindergarten students.

              <h2>2. Math Blaster</h2> 
              The goal at Math Blaster is clear: “Your success depends on your ability to use your brain and logic skills.” With an exciting theme featuring aliens and outer space, Math Blaster lets your students become intergalactic heroes based on their math operation and critical thinking skills. Registration is required, but the game itself is free. Be sure to check out the Teacher Section to find Math Blaster for the Classroom.

              <h2>3. Multiplication.com</h2> 
              From the Multiplication Grand Prix to the Knight and the Princess, students can practice their basic math skills in a fun and engaging way on this math site for kids. There are additional resources available on the website for parents and teachers who want to help reinforce and teach skills. Check out the Classroom Games section for off-line fun.

              <h2>4. Learn Zillion</h2> 
              Find lessons that complement what you are studying in the classroom based on the Common Core Standards for grades 3 to 9. While less of a math game website than some of the others on the list, Learn Zillion provides a strong, comprehensive approach to online math education. Take time to explore the free resources available to teachers and parents.

              <h2>5. Hooda Math</h2> 
              Logic and reasoning, math fact practice and more make up the free educational games at Hooda Math. There are quite a few games that call for higher order thinking and ask students to problem solve to complete the activities. These challenges help to sharpen students’ math skills through an engaging online activity.

              <h2>6. Manga High</h2> 
              Manga High offers free and subscription packages to classroom and homeschool teachers. The free website allows students to play basic games to reinforce math skills and compete against the computer or others. The subscription version gives teachers the opportunity to track students’ progress and determine if there are any gaps in their basic skills.

              <h2>7. Math Game Time</h2> 
              Designed for students from pre-K through 7th grade, Math Game Time offers fun, educational games focused on critical math concepts. With options like Integer War, Ratio Martian and Jet Ski Addition, students quickly engage with games that are on-target for their grade and the Common Core Standards.

              <h2>8. Math Playground</h2> 
              “Play with Numbers and Give Your Brain a Workout” is the motto of Math Playground. Assign students games to play related to logic, number skills practice, geometry, algebra, probability, fractions and more. There are also math word problems and video instructions to help students remember how to solve them. Does your school use Singapore Math? Math Playground has a section dedicated to it.

              <h2>9. CryptoKids </h2> 
              America’s CryptoKids website is sponsored by the NSA and focuses on code-making and code-breaking. Students can learn more about cryptology and create and break common codes. There are student resources, high school programs and even college programs that can be explored. While the website may not focus on basic math skills, cryptology requires critical thinking abilities that are essential to student success.

              <h2>10. BBC KS2 Bitesize</h2> 
              Math practice with a bit of British humor is what Bitesize is all about. Based off of Britain’s standards, the website still offers ample practice with decimals, factors, multiples, addition, subtraction and more. The games are amusing, but the skill practice is substantial.

              <h2>11. Cool Math Games</h2> 
              Coolmath-Games has exactly what the name implies: fun and unique math learning opportunities for students. One of the most interesting features is an online jigsaw puzzle section that features a variety of photos turned into puzzles. This is especially helpful for developing spatial relations in young learners. They have an extensive preview and review of precalculus and calculus in addition to their elementary and middle school games and reviews.
              It is a comprehensive website worth examining.
